- 👋 Hello GitHub World, I’m puffiinn.
- 👀 I’m interested in searching and trying new things, especially for tech stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring UX design, color science, Figma and some generative AI tools such as Stable Difussion, builder.io, Midjourney, Bing chat and GitHub Copilot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning how to learn!
- 📫 Reach me through GitHub!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Neither am I an engineer nor do I receive any engineering-related education or official training.
